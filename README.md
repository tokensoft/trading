The official repo for Tokensoft Trading. This repo will be used for tracking issues and bugs while the product is in beta.

Tokensoft Trading is non-custodial and trades are peer-to-peer. Weâ€™ve created a wrapper around Hashflow to provide native trading functionality inside of the Tokensoft application.
